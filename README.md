# Python Learning Journey

A comprehensive repository designed to guide you through the fundamentals and advanced concepts of Python programming. Whether you're a complete beginner or looking to refresh your knowledge, this repository provides structured learning paths, code examples, and resources to help you master Python.

## üöÄ Core Topics Covered:

* **Introduction to Python:**
    * What is Python?
    * Setting up your development environment (Python interpreter, IDEs like VS Code/PyCharm).
    * Basic syntax, comments, and variables.
    * Running your first Python script.

* **Data Types and Structures:**
    * **Primitive Types:** Integers, Floats, Strings, Booleans.
    * **Collections:**
        * Lists (mutable, ordered sequences).
        * Tuples (immutable, ordered sequences).
        * Dictionaries (key-value pairs, unordered).
        * Sets (unordered collections of unique elements).

* **Operators:**
    * Arithmetic Operators.
    * Comparison Operators.
    * Logical Operators.
    * Assignment Operators.
    * Identity and Membership Operators.

* **Control Flow:**
    * Conditional Statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`).
    * Loops (`for` loops, `while` loops).
    * Loop control statements (`break`, `continue`, `pass`).

* **Functions:**
    * Defining and calling functions.
    * Function arguments (positional, keyword, default).
    * `*args` and `**kwargs`.
    * Return values.
    * Lambda functions.

* **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):**
    * Classes and Objects.
    * Attributes and Methods.
    * Constructors (`__init__`).
    * Inheritance.
    * Polymorphism.
    * Encapsulation.
    * Special (Dunder) Methods.

* **Modules and Packages:**
    * Importing modules.
    * Creating your own modules.
    * Understanding packages.
    * Common built-in modules (e.g., `math`, `random`, `datetime`).

* **File Handling:**
    * Reading from and writing to files.
    * File modes (`'r'`, `'w'`, `'a'`, `'r+'`).
    * The `with` statement for automatic file closing.
    * Working with different file formats (CSV, JSON - basics).

* **Error Handling and Exceptions:**
    * Understanding errors and exceptions.
    * `try`, `except`, `else`, `finally` blocks.
    * Raising custom exceptions.

* **Advanced Topics (Introduction):**
    * Decorators.
    * Generators and Iterators.
    * Context Managers.
    * Regular Expressions (basic usage).
    * Virtual Environments (`venv`).

## üìö Resources & Structure:

Each topic will typically include:

* **Explanations:** Clear and concise descriptions of concepts.
* **Code Examples:** Practical, runnable code snippets demonstrating each concept.
* **Exercises:** Small challenges to test your understanding.
* **Best Practices:** Tips for writing clean, efficient, and Pythonic code.
